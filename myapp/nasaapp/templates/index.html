        <h3>The Crab Nebula Seen in New Light by NASA’s Webb</h3>
        <p>
          NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has gazed at the Crab Nebula, a
          supernova remnant located 6,500 light-years away in the constellation
          Taurus. Since the recording of this energetic event in 1054 CE by
          11th-century astronomers, the Crab Nebula has continued to draw
          attention and additional study as scientists seek to understand the
          conditions, behavior, and after-effects of supernovae through thorough
          study of the Crab, a relatively nearby example.

        <h3>Rusty Red Waters in Madagascar</h3>
        <p>
          Iron-rich sediment colors the red-orange waters of the Betsiboka River Delta in Madagascar in this image taken by an astronaut on the International Space Station on Sept. 30, 2023.
          The sediment can clog waterways in the delta’s estuarial environment, but it can also form new islands that become colonized by mangroves. Despite its rusty color, this artery of water is important for biodiversity. Within the Betsiboka River Delta, the estuary supplies food, such as seagrasses, to the endangered green turtle and vulnerable dugong, or sea cow.

        <h3>Hubble Views a Vibrant Virgo Cluster Galaxy</h3>
        <p>
          It’s easy to get swept up in the swirling starry arms of this intermediate spiral galaxy, NGC 4654, in the constellation Virgo. The galaxy has a bright center and is labeled “intermediate” because it has characteristics of both unbarred and barred spirals. NGC 4654 is just north of the celestial equator, making it visible from the northern hemisphere and most of the southern hemisphere. The galaxy is around 55 million light-years from Earth.
